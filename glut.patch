Looking at the specifications of GLUT, I realized glutGetModifiers was only available during key and button callbacks but not during motion or passive motions.

I changed the source a little bit to avoid this problem and it works fine on windows.  I also changed it for X11 but didn't had the opportunity to test it as yet.

Is there (still) any reason for limiting glutGetModifiers?

Using the modifiers is quite useful for advanced interaction.
Following are the modifications I made.

On windows, the modifications are in win32_windowproc.c:

+     __glutModifierMask = getModifierMask();
        if ( window->motion && down )
        {
            window->motion( x, y );
        }
        if ( window->passive && ! down )
        {
            window->passive( x, y );
        }
+     __glutModifierMask = ( unsigned int )~0;

For X11, the modifications are in glut_event.c:

              __glutSetWindow(window);
+              __glutModifierMask = event.xmotion.state;
              window->motion(event.xmotion.x, event.xmotion.y);
+              __glutModifierMask = ~0;

and
+              __glutModifierMask = event.xmotion.state;
              window->passive(event.xmotion.x,
                event.xmotion.y);
+              __glutModifierMask = ~0;
