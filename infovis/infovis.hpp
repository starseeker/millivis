/*! \mainpage The InfoVis library
*
* \section Introduction
*
* The InfoVis library is designed to build information visualization programs
* that can visualize around one million items with a decent
* interaction speed.  It relies on the OpenGL graphics library for
* rendering, as well as several external libraries:
* - glut on top of OpenGL for ease of use
* - freetype for font rendering
* - the Boehm-Weiser garbage collector for C and C++ to simplify the
*   programming
* - the Boost C++ libraries
* - the ZLib library for compressing and uncompressing files
* - the PNG library for loading and saving PNG images
* - the Expat XML parser in C.
