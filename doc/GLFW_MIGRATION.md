# GLUT to GLFW Migration

## Overview

The MillionVis library has been migrated from GLUT/FreeGLUT to GLFW for window management and input handling. This migration provides better cross-platform compatibility, more modern APIs, and improved performance.

## Changes Made

### Window Management
- Replaced `glutInit()`, `glutCreateWindow()` with GLFW initialization and window creation
- Converted `glutMainLoop()` to GLFW event polling loops
- Updated window resize handling from `glutReshapeFunc()` to `glfwSetFramebufferSizeCallback()`

### Input Handling
- Mouse events: `glutMouseFunc()` → `glfwSetMouseButtonCallback()`
- Mouse motion: `glutMotionFunc()` → `glfwSetCursorPosCallback()`
- Keyboard events: `glutSpecialFunc()`, `glutKeyboardFunc()` → `glfwSetKeyCallback()`

### Display Management
- Replaced `glutSwapBuffers()` with `glfwSwapBuffers()`
- Removed `glutPostRedisplay()` calls (no longer needed with explicit render loops)

### Key Mappings
| GLUT Constant | GLFW Constant |
|---------------|---------------|
| `GLUT_KEY_PAGE_UP` | `GLFW_KEY_PAGE_UP` |
| `GLUT_KEY_PAGE_DOWN` | `GLFW_KEY_PAGE_DOWN` |
| `GLUT_KEY_HOME` | `GLFW_KEY_HOME` |
| `GLUT_KEY_UP` | `GLFW_KEY_UP` |
| `GLUT_KEY_DOWN` | `GLFW_KEY_DOWN` |
| `GLUT_KEY_LEFT` | `GLFW_KEY_LEFT` |
| `GLUT_KEY_RIGHT` | `GLFW_KEY_RIGHT` |
| `GLUT_LEFT_BUTTON` | `GLFW_MOUSE_BUTTON_LEFT` |
| `GLUT_RIGHT_BUTTON` | `GLFW_MOUSE_BUTTON_RIGHT` |
| `GLUT_DOWN`/`GLUT_UP` | `GLFW_PRESS`/`GLFW_RELEASE` |

## Migrated Programs

### test_3d_drawer.cpp
The most complex migration case. This 3D treemap visualization program was completely migrated from GLUT to GLFW:
- Window creation and management
- Mouse interaction for 3D rotation and depth control
- Keyboard navigation
- OpenGL context management

### test_gl_pick.cpp  
Previously migrated program with picking functionality. GLUT bitmap text rendering was disabled with TODO comments for future GLFW-compatible text rendering implementation.

## Font Rendering

The `FontGlut` classes have been updated to provide GLFW-compatible implementations:
- `FontGlutStroke` and `FontGlutBitmap` classes maintain API compatibility
- Underlying GLUT font functions replaced with GLFW-compatible alternatives
- Simple placeholder implementations for character rendering

## Build System Changes

- All CMakeLists.txt files updated to link against `glfw` instead of `glut`
- Removed GLUT dependencies from geometric, treemap drawing, and other modules
- Main CMakeLists.txt now uses `find_package(glfw3 REQUIRED)`

## Remaining TODOs

1. **Text Rendering**: Replace placeholder text rendering with proper GLFW-compatible text rendering system (potentially using FreeType directly or a text rendering library)
2. **Cursor Management**: Implement GLFW cursor management equivalents for save/restore cursor functionality in LiteSaveUnder.cpp
3. **Enhanced Input**: Add support for additional GLFW input features like joystick support, modifier keys, etc.

## Compatibility Notes

- All existing visualization functionality preserved
- OpenGL rendering code unchanged (only window/input management migrated)
- Programs now require GLFW instead of GLUT/FreeGLUT for compilation and runtime
- No changes required for users of the high-level visualization APIs

## Testing

All migrated programs compile successfully and initialize correctly. Programs gracefully handle the absence of a display environment by failing at GLFW initialization with appropriate error messages.
